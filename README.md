## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project, I learned how to create a responsive design using mobile-first workflow. I used Flexbox to position elements and practiced using media queries to adjust the layout for different screen sizes.

I also learned how to fix issues with image paths and troubleshoot broken images, ensuring that all assets are displayed correctly.

```html
<div class="qr-code-container">
  <img src="./images/qr-code.png" alt="QR code" />
</div>
```

```css
.qr-code-container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  width: 100%;
  background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
}
```

### Continued development

I plan to continue working on responsive designs and practicing mobile-first development. I also want to explore other CSS layout techniques, such as CSS Grid, to further improve my understanding of web layouts.
